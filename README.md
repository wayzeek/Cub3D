## 📖 Introduction

Developed under the influence of Wolfenstein 3D, the first true “First Person Shooter”, cub3D challenges you to navigate a maze in a 3D space using ray-casting techniques.

## ✨ Goals

This project focuses on the use of C, basic algorithms, and graphic programming skills like managing windows, colors, and events to simulate a 3D maze navigation experience.

## 📏 Common Instructions

- Must be written in C.
- Comply with the Norm.
- No unexpected quits (segmentation faults, etc.).
- All memory must be properly managed.
- Provide a Makefile with `all`, `clean`, `fclean`, `re`, `bonus`.
- Submit work to your assigned git repository.

## 🚀 Mandatory Part

### Features

- Realistic 3D representation using Ray-Casting.
- Use miniLibX for graphical representation.
- Manage different wall textures and set distinct floor and ceiling colors.
- Window management must remain fluid.
- Include basic movement and view controls.

### Technical Requirements

- Program takes a .cub format map as input.
- Handle all mandatory elements like wall textures and player controls.
